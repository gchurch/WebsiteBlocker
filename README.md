# Website Blocker

I created this Chrome extension because I regularly find myself spending too much time on social media websites. This extension allows you to create a list of blocked websites which the browser is blocked from visiting. There are similar extensions on the Chrome Web Store but I found that they were a bit buggy.

This Chrome extension was created using React with help from this template: https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react.
